{{{after : Memory Management}}}

In Static as well as Dynamic Languages there is a special process call garbage Collection

which is nothing but,
    A reference variable in the stack pointing to a specific object in a heap
    all of sudden when the reference variable points to another object
    the already pointed object becomes abandoned(when a object does not have a reference variable)

    such objects are removed when garbage collection hits...
