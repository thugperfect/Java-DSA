************Static and Dynamic**************

There are two types of languages based on code execution

these are Static and Dynamic execution

Static :
    Type checking is done at Compile Time.
    [ 
        Type checking is checking the data type of the input variable
        eg: int a = 10
        while compiling the code that is when the byte code generation 
        process, it checks for the data type. 
    ]
    In such Static Languages, Data Type specifying is compulsary.

    eg:java,c,c++.

Dynamic :
    Type checking is done only at the Run time 
    [
        Runtime is the process after compilation
        where the machine code is executed by the computer.
    ]
    In such languages, it is not compulsary to specify data.

    eg: python.
